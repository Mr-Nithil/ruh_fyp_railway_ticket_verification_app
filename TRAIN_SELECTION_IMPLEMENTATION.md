# Train Selection Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a train selection feature to the HomeScreen, allowing users to select an active train schedule before scanning tickets. The selected train's schedule ID is saved in SharedPreferences and persists across app sessions.

## Files Created

### 1. `lib/core/services/shared_preferences_service.dart`
A service class to manage SharedPreferences operations for storing and retrieving selected train information.

**Key Methods:**
- `saveSelectedSchedule()` - Saves schedule ID, train name, and route info
- `getSelectedScheduleId()` - Retrieves saved schedule ID
- `hasSelectedSchedule()` - Checks if a train is selected
- `clearSelectedSchedule()` - Clears all saved train data
- `getSelectedScheduleDetails()` - Gets all saved details at once

### 2. `lib/features/home/widgets/train_selection_popup.dart`
A beautiful, full-featured popup dialog that displays all active train schedules from the database.

**Features:**
- Lists all active trains with detailed information
- Shows train name, route (from/to stations), departure/arrival times
- Visual indication of currently selected train
- Loading state with spinner
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Empty state when no trains are available
- Saves selection to SharedPreferences
- Shows success message after selection

**UI Components:**
- Gradient header with train icon
- Scrollable list of train cards
- Selection indicator (checkmark)
- Color-coded cards (green when selected)
- Time formatting (HH:MM)
- Footer with info message

## Files Modified

### 1. `pubspec.yaml`
Added dependency:
```yaml
shared_preferences: ^2.3.4
```

### 2. `lib/features/home/home_screen.dart`
Major updates to integrate train selection feature:

**New Imports:**
- `SharedPreferencesService`
- `TrainSelectionPopup`

**New State Variables:**
- `_prefsService` - SharedPreferences service instance
- `_hasSelectedTrain` - Boolean tracking if train is selected
- `_selectedTrainName` - Name of selected train for display

**New Methods:**
- `_loadSelectedTrain()` - Loads saved train from SharedPreferences on init
- `_showTrainSelectionPopup()` - Opens the train selection dialog
- `_showTrainNotSelectedDialog()` - Shows alert when scan is attempted without train selection
- `_buildSelectedTrainCard()` - Builds the train selection status card

**Modified Methods:**
- `initState()` - Now calls `_loadSelectedTrain()` to load saved selection
- `_handleVerifyTicket()` - Now checks if train is selected before allowing scan
- `_buildFeatureButton()` - Enhanced with:
  - Optional `color` parameter for custom button colors
  - `isDisabled` parameter to disable buttons
  - Visual indication when disabled
  - Helper text when disabled

**UI Changes:**
- Added "Selected Train Card" showing current selection status
- Replaced "Verify" button with "Select Train" button
- "Scan Ticket" button now:
  - Disabled (50% opacity) when no train selected
  - Shows "Select train first" hint when disabled
  - Only works after train selection
- "Select Train" button uses blue color scheme

## User Flow

1. **First Time User:**
   - Opens app → No train selected (orange warning card shown)
   - "Scan Ticket" button is disabled
   - User must tap "Select Train" button or the warning card
   - Popup shows all active trains
   - User selects a train
   - Success message shown
   - Selection saved to SharedPreferences
   - "Scan Ticket" button becomes enabled

2. **Returning User:**
   - Opens app → Previously selected train is loaded automatically
   - Green card shows selected train name
   - "Scan Ticket" button is enabled immediately
   - User can change train by tapping card or "Select Train" button

3. **Attempting to Scan Without Selection:**
   - User taps "Scan Ticket" when no train selected
   - Alert dialog appears explaining train selection is required
   - Dialog has "Select Train" button for quick access to selection popup

## Technical Details

### SharedPreferences Keys
- `selected_schedule_id` - The schedule ID
- `selected_train_name` - The train name (for display)
- `selected_route_info` - Route info (for display)

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `ScheduleController` to fetch train schedules
- Queries `RW_SET_Schedule` table with JOINs to:
  - `RW_SET_Train` (train name)
  - `RW_SET_Route` (route details)
  - `RW_SET_Station` (station names)
- Only shows active trains (`isActive = true`)

### State Management
- Uses `setState()` for local state management
- SharedPreferences for persistence
- Callback pattern for popup → parent communication

## Benefits

1. **User Experience:**
   - Clear visual indication of train selection status
   - Prevents accidental scanning without context
   - Persists selection across app restarts
   - Easy to change selected train

2. **Data Integrity:**
   - Ensures tickets are verified against correct train
   - Prevents verification errors
   - Maintains context for verification process

3. **UI/UX:**
   - Beautiful, modern design
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Informative error states

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] First-time flow (no saved train)
- [ ] Returning user flow (train pre-selected)
- [ ] Train selection from popup
- [ ] Scan button disabled state
- [ ] Scan button attempt without train
- [ ] Train selection persistence across app restarts
- [ ] Empty state (no active trains)
- [ ] Error state (database connection failure)
- [ ] Multiple train selection (changing selection)
- [ ] UI on different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

1. Add search/filter functionality in popup
2. Show more train details (class availability, etc.)
3. Add "Recently Selected" section
4. Implement train schedule refresh/sync
5. Add offline mode with cached schedules

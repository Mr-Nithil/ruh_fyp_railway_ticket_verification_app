```

## 📊 Status Logic

The screen intelligently determines ticket status:

```
Priority Order:
1. Fraud Confirmed → RED "FRAUD"
2. Inactive User → ORANGE "INACTIVE USER"  
3. Checked & Approved → GREEN "APPROVED"
4. Checked & Not Approved → RED "REJECTED"
5. Default → ORANGE "PENDING"
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Navigation from home screen
- [x] Train selection requirement

- [x] Empty state display
- [x] Error state display
- [x] Ticket list rendering
- [x] Status color coding
- [x] Ticket detail navigation
- [x] Back navigation
- [x] Pull-to-refresh
- [ ] Database integration (requires testing with real data)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Select a train schedule** from the home screen (Select Train button)
2. **Tap "Ticket List"** button (will be disabled if no train selected)
3. **View all bookings** for that schedule
4. **Tap any ticket** to see detailed information
5. **Pull down** to refresh the list

## 💡 Next Steps

5. Test different ticket statuses

## ⚠️ Minor Notes

- Two minor linting warnings about unused private fields (won't affect functionality)
- The `_selectedScheduleId` and `_permissionChecked` fields are set but not read
- These can be safely ignored or removed if preferred

## 📱 Screenshots to Capture

1. Home screen with "Ticket List" button
2. Ticket list with multiple tickets (different statuses)
3. Ticket detail screen
4. Empty state
